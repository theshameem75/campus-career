description: "Configure a SELISE Blocks project's data model via the blocks CLI — never raw fetch/curl against api.seliseblocks.com. Covers data-source config (data config get/create/update), schema authoring and push (data schema list/pull/push, plus granular get/fields/info commands), data-access policies (data rules pull/deploy/policy), field-level validation rules (data validation *), and reloading so changes go live (data reload, or the composed data sync). Use for defining, editing, securing, validating, or reloading a project's DATA MODEL — schema fields, access policies, and validation rules."

When invoking a project-scoped `blocks` command, either use the resolved account's saved selection or pass `--project <tenantId>` for that one command without changing saved state. `--project` applies to CLI commands only, never SDK calls.

# Blocks Data — Gateway Configuration

The Data schema/rules model of a Blocks project is configured entirely through the `blocks` CLI now — there is no supported reason to hand-roll `fetch`/`curl` calls against `api.seliseblocks.com/data/v4` anymore. The CLI reads and writes local files under `blocks/data/` and talks to the Data service for you.

**Prerequisite:** `blocks init` has been run (creates `blocks/data/schemas/` and `blocks/data/rules.json`) and a project is selected (`blocks use <tenantId>`). If either is missing, or auth state is unknown, run the blocks-bootstrap skill first — it covers `auth status` probing, login, and project selection in detail; this skill assumes that's already done.

## Check the data-source configuration first

Before touching schemas, confirm what database actually backs this project's Data Gateway:

```bash
blocks data config get --json
```

By default every Blocks project runs on **Blocks-managed storage** — most of the time this is the only data-source command you'll ever need, just to confirm it. Only reach for the mutating commands below if the user explicitly wants to point the gateway at their own external database — this is a rare, deliberate action, not a routine step:

```bash
blocks data config create --connection-string "<connection string>" --database-name "<name>" --dry-run --json
blocks data config create --connection-string "<connection string>" --database-name "<name>" --yes --json

blocks data config update --item-id <id> --connection-string "<new connection string>" --dry-run --json
blocks data config update --item-id <id> --connection-string "<new connection string>" --yes --json
```

`data config update` also takes `--database-name`, `--collection-name-pattern`, and `--collection-name-editable` (boolean) — use these to rename the target database or adjust how collection names are derived/whether they're editable, on an existing configuration (`--item-id` required either way). The update reads the current configuration and merges, so a connection-string-only change keeps `isCollectionNameEditable` and `collectionNamePattern` (the PUT would otherwise reset them to false/empty).

Treat `--connection-string` as a secret: never print it back unredacted, and don't log it outside the command's own `--dry-run` preview (which redacts it).

## Probe first, ask second

Don't assume the local workspace matches the cloud project. Before editing anything, find out what's actually there:

```bash
blocks data schema list --json     # what schemas exist in the selected project (read-only)
blocks data schema pull --json     # sync them into blocks/data/schemas/*.json locally
blocks data rules pull --json      # sync data-access policies into blocks/data/rules.json
```

Pulling before editing avoids clobbering schema changes someone else made in the portal or another session.

## Workflow: define or edit a schema

1. **Pull current state** (above), so local files reflect the project.
2. **Edit** the relevant JSON file(s) under `blocks/data/schemas/` — add/rename fields, change types, add a new schema file. This is plain file editing; there's no *file-oriented* CLI subcommand for individual field edits (`data schema push` always sends the whole schema), you edit the JSON directly. (`data schema fields` exists as a raw API alternative that adds/updates fields on an existing schema without touching the local file — see "More granular Schema commands" below — but for the local-file workflow described here, just edit the JSON.)
3. **Validate locally, no API call:**
   ```bash
   blocks data validate --json
   ```
   Fix anything it flags before going further — this catches malformed schema/rules JSON before it reaches the network.
4. **Dry-run the push** to see exactly what would change (create vs. update, which schemas):
   ```bash
   blocks data schema push --dry-run --json
   ```
5. **Get user approval**, then push for real:
   ```bash
   blocks data schema push --yes --json
   ```
   This is mutating — it creates new schemas and updates existing ones in a single call. Never skip straight to `--yes`.
6. **Reload so it goes live.** Schema/rule edits are staged until reload succeeds — the runtime gateway doesn't see them before this:
   ```bash
   blocks data reload --dry-run --json
   blocks data reload --yes --json
   ```

**Shortcut — recommended default:** validation, schema push, rules deploy, and reload are exactly what `blocks data sync` automates behind a single confirmation. Rules deployment comes from the pulled/edited `blocks/data/rules.json`; it is not a separately numbered step above.

```bash
blocks data sync --dry-run --json
blocks data sync --yes --json
```

Reach for `data sync` first unless the user specifically wants to inspect or run one step at a time — it's also the only way to *guarantee* the reload actually happens: nothing else in this CLI calls `data reload` automatically, so a bare `schema push` (or `rules deploy`) without a following `data reload` can leave changes staged but not live. Keep the manual step-by-step above for cases where you want to push schema without touching rules, or need to stop and inspect a dry-run at an individual step.

## Workflow: data-access policies / schema security

Same shape as schemas, in `blocks/data/rules.json`:

```bash
blocks data rules pull --json                 # get current policies locally
# edit blocks/data/rules.json
blocks data validate --json                   # local-only check
blocks data rules deploy --dry-run --json     # preview
blocks data rules deploy --yes --json         # apply, after approval
blocks data reload --dry-run --json           # then reload so it's live
blocks data reload --yes --json
```

**Shortcut:** `blocks data sync` covers this too (validate → schema push → rules deploy → reload, one confirmation) — see the schema workflow above.

`data rules deploy` applies schema security and data-access policies together — there's no finer-grained CLI split between "field access level" and "policy rule"; both live in `rules.json`.

For a single policy without touching the rest of `rules.json`, use the granular commands instead of a full pull/edit/deploy round-trip:

```bash
blocks data rules policy get <schemaName> --json          # read-only, all policies for one schema
blocks data rules policy delete <itemId> --dry-run --json
blocks data rules policy delete <itemId> --yes --json
```

There's no single-policy `create`/`update` command — those go through `data rules deploy` (it POSTs new policies and PUTs existing ones from `rules.json`).

## Workflow: field-level validation rules

Data validations are a separate resource from schema field types — a schema field's `type` says *what kind* of value it holds, a validation rule says *what values are acceptable*. There's no file-oriented pull/push for these yet (no `blocks/data/validations.json`); work with them directly:

```bash
blocks data validation by-schema <schemaId> --json                        # everything for one schema
blocks data validation by-schema-field <schemaId> <fieldName> --json      # one field's rule
blocks data validation list --schema-id <schemaId> --json                 # paginated browse
```

Create or update a rule (upsert: omit `--item-id` to create, pass it to update). The `validations` array itself has no scalar-flag equivalent — pass it via `--body`/`--file`:

```bash
blocks data validation save --schema-id <schemaId> --field-name email \
  --body '{"validations":[{"type":1,"value":"^[^@]+@[^@]+\\.[^@]+$","errorMessage":"Enter a valid email","isActive":true}]}' \
  --dry-run --json
blocks data validation save --schema-id <schemaId> --field-name email \
  --body '{"validations":[{"type":1,"value":"^[^@]+@[^@]+\\.[^@]+$","errorMessage":"Enter a valid email","isActive":true}]}' \
  --yes --json

blocks data validation delete <validationId> --dry-run --json
blocks data validation delete <validationId> --yes --json
```

`type` inside a `validations` entry is the Data Gateway's `ValidationType` enum, zero-based in declaration order — `0` NotEmpty, `1` Regex, `2` MinLength, `3` MaxLength, `4` LengthRange, `5` Equal, `6` NotEqual, `7` GreaterThan, `8` LessThan, `9` GreaterThanOrEqual, `10` LessThanOrEqual, `11` Range. The example above uses `1`, so `value` is the regex. `value` is interpreted per type: a pattern for `1`, a number for the length and comparison types, a range for `4`/`11`.

The separate `--schema-type` flag on the `data schema *` commands is a *different* enum with no zero: `1` Entity, `2` Dto.

The API doesn't publish named constants for the `type` enum in its schema — if the user needs a specific validation type and you're not sure of its numeric value, run `data validation by-schema-field` on a field with a known-working rule (e.g. one set up in the portal) to see the value in context, rather than guessing.

## More granular Schema commands

`data schema list/pull/push` cover the everyday file-based workflow above. For one-off lookups or advanced schema metadata, these go straight to the API without touching local files:

```bash
blocks data schema get <id> --json                    # single schema by id
blocks data schema get-by-name <schemaName> --json    # full field detail by collection name
blocks data schema aggregation --json                  # schemas + access-level summary (Public/User/Custom x Read/Write/Edit/Delete)
blocks data schema change-logs --json                  # unadapted change logs; data reload clears these
blocks data schema delete <id> --dry-run --json        # irreversible
blocks data schema delete <id> --yes --json
```

`data schema info list/save/update` and `data schema fields` are the two-step alternative to `data schema push` (metadata first, fields second) — prefer the file-based `push` workflow above for normal schema authoring; reach for these only if the user specifically wants to add fields to an existing schema without touching its full JSON file, or needs the raw `/schemas/info` metadata-only shape.

Every mutating command here supports `--dry-run`; run it, show the user, then `--yes` — the standard pattern across every `blocks` mutation.

## What this skill does NOT cover (and why)

Two things the old, pre-CLI version of this skill used to handle no longer have any supported path — do not paper over the gap by inventing a command or improvising a raw API call:

- **Mock/sample data cleanup.** There is no `blocks data mock*` command, and the SDK's `data.utilities.mockData()` (in `@seliseblocks/client`) is **read-only** — it inventories mock data, it does not delete it. If a user asks to "wipe the demo data" or "clean up sample records," tell them plainly: this isn't exposed in the current CLI or SDK. Check whether the OS portal (`https://os.seliseblocks.com`) has a Data-section control for it; if not, there's no way to do this today short of deleting real records through generated GraphQL mutations one at a time, which is not the same thing and should not be presented as equivalent.
- **Schema export/import between projects** (e.g. cloning a dev project's data model into staging). No CLI command and no SDK method exist for this. If a user wants to copy a data model between projects, the honest answer is: not supported by current tooling. Check the OS portal for a manual option; otherwise the only fallback is manually recreating schemas in the target project's `blocks/data/schemas/` and pushing them — which is a manual reconstruction, not a real export/import, and should be described as such.

## The one thing that goes through the SDK, not the CLI

**AI-generated regex for field validation** is real, but it lives only in `@seliseblocks/client`, not in `blocks`. There's no CLI command for it because it's a single request/response utility call better suited to being scripted inline in app code than wrapped as a terminal command:

```ts
import { createBlocksClient } from "@seliseblocks/client";

const blocks = createBlocksClient({
  apiUrl: "https://api.seliseblocks.com",
  xBlocksKey: "<project-tenant-id>",
  accessToken: () => currentAccessToken
});

const suggestion = await blocks.data.utilities.generateRegex({
  description: "a valid US phone number, digits only, 10 characters"
});
```

Once you have the pattern, put it into the relevant field's validation in `blocks/data/schemas/<Schema>.json` and continue with the normal push/reload workflow above — the CLI genuinely has no equivalent command.

## Gotchas

- **Reload or it didn't happen.** `data schema push` and `data rules deploy` stage changes; `data reload` is what makes them visible to the runtime gateway (and to any app querying it via `@seliseblocks/client`).
- **`data validate` is local-only** — it does not confirm the push will succeed against the server, only that the JSON is well-formed. Still run `--dry-run` on the actual push/deploy/reload commands.
- **Never define platform-managed system fields** (`ItemId`, `CreatedDate`, `CreatedBy`, `LastUpdatedDate`, `LastUpdatedBy`, `Language`, `OrganizationId`, `Tags`) in your schema JSON — Blocks adds these to every entity schema automatically.
- **Check `data config get` before assuming Blocks-managed storage.** Most projects use it, but don't state it as fact without checking — and never create/update a data source configuration without explicit user intent, it repoints the project at a different database.

## Example trigger prompts

- "Add an `email` field to my `Customer` schema and push it."
- "Pull the current schemas so I can see what's already defined."
- "Validate my local schema files before I push."
- "Set up a data-access policy so only admins can delete `Order` records."
- "Reload the data schema, I just pushed some field changes."
- "Suggest a regex for validating a postal code field."
- "What database is this project actually using?" → `data config get`.
- "Add a validation rule so the `phone` field only accepts digits." → `data validation save`.
- "What validation rules exist on the `Order` schema?" → `data validation by-schema`.
- "Delete this one data-access policy without touching the rest of my rules file." → `data rules policy delete`.
- "Can you wipe the demo/sample data from my project?" → explain this isn't supported by the CLI or SDK today; point to the portal.
- "Copy my dev project's schemas over to staging." → explain export/import isn't supported by current tooling; point to the portal or manual recreation.
