When invoking a project-scoped `blocks` command, either use the resolved account's saved selection or pass `--project <tenantId>` for that one command without changing saved state. `--project` applies to CLI commands only, never SDK calls.

# Blocks IAM — SSO / OIDC Configuration

Setting up SSO for a Blocks project means provisioning two related tenant records: an **OIDC client** (the app-facing public client used for hosted login) and an **identity provider** (the record the hosted-login redirect/callback flow actually authenticates against). Both are exposed by real, implemented `blocks` CLI commands — this is not a portal-only action.

## The one thing to get right: which login is this?

Don't conflate the CLI's own login with the identity provider this skill configures.

| | `blocks login` | The one THIS skill covers |
|---|---|---|
| What it's for | Lets `blocks` itself authenticate | Lets **end users log into the user's own app** via hosted SSO |
| Client type | Packaged into the CLI - nothing to register, no secret to hold | Public (browser client, no secret) |
| Registered via | Nothing to register - just run `blocks login` | `blocks auth oidc-clients save` / `blocks auth idp create`, or the portal |
| Owned by | **blocks-bootstrap** skill | **This skill**, handing off to **blocks-iam-sso-oidc-implementation** |

If the user is asking "how do I get `blocks` logged in" or hits `not_logged_in`, that's **blocks-bootstrap**, not this skill. This skill is about the identity provider that sits in front of *the user's own application's* login page.

## Decision tree

All of these commands are project-scoped: they need a selected project (`blocks use <tenantId>` or `--project`) and run against an impersonated project token, not the CLI's own account token.

1. **Check for an existing OIDC client.** `blocks auth oidc-clients list [--json]` / `blocks auth oidc-clients get <clientId> [--json]`. `client_secret` is excluded from list/get responses — you only ever see it once, at creation or `rotate-secret` time. If a suitable public client already exists (matching redirect URI / display name), reuse its id — you're done, skip to handoff. To add a redirect URI to an existing client (the common case after a deployment gets its URL), re-save with `--item-id <clientId> --redirect-uris "<full list incl. the new one>"` — the CLI reads the stored client and merges, so every unmentioned field (`--auto-redirect`, PKCE, scopes, …) is kept; only the list you pass is replaced. Then `get` it back to confirm. `redirect_uri_not_registered` at login is exactly this: register `https://<origin>/login/callback` for EVERY origin the app is served from — the local HTTPS dev origin *and* each deployed URL (`blocks release repos list --json`, the `url` field). `release setup`/`deploy`/`domain set` check this themselves and can append it with `--register-callback`.
2. **If none exists, create one:**
   ```
   blocks auth oidc-clients save \
     --client-display-name "<app name>" \
     --client-type public \
     --redirect-uris "https://<app-domain>/login/callback" \
     --require-pkce --active \
     --scope "openid profile" \
     --register-as-identity-provider \
     [--dry-run] [--yes]
   ```
   `--require-mfa [--allowed-mfa-methods 1,2]` belongs here too when this client must force MFA. It is a **third, independent MFA gate**: IAM's login policy requires MFA if the tenant requires it, the user's role requires it, the user enrolled voluntarily, **or** the client sets `requireMfa`. `allowedMfaMethods` narrows, never widens — IAM intersects it with the tenant's allowed list, so naming a method the tenant hasn't enabled leaves nothing usable. Values are IAM's `UserMfaType` (`1` TOTP, `2` Email; `0` is None and `3`/`4` have no provider) — see blocks-iam-mfa.

   This mirrors exactly what `blocks new web`'s interactive OIDC-client prompt does when scaffolding a new web app. `--register-as-identity-provider` is what turns this from "just an OIDC client" into something the hosted-login redirect flow (`auth.idp.redirectToProvider()` / `auth.idp.callback()`) can authenticate against — per the CLI's own scaffold help text, this registers the client "as a Blocks OIDC identity provider" in the same call.
3. **Verify the auto-created provider before handing off.** `--register-as-identity-provider` creates the provider record for you. Current CLI builds the provider discovery URL by default, matching the portal checkbox behavior, but still check what landed with `blocks auth idp list --json`. If an older provider has `authorizationUrl` null, hosted login will not redirect: the initiate call behind `auth.idp.redirectToProvider()` builds its target as `provider.AuthorizationUrl ?? ""` plus a query string, so the browser navigates to the app's own origin with OIDC params attached. The repair:
   ```
   blocks auth idp update <providerItemId> \
     --authorization-url "<tenant authorize endpoint>" \
     --token-url "<tenant token endpoint>" \
     --user-info-url "<tenant userinfo endpoint>" \
     [--dry-run] [--yes]
   ```
   `idp update` is the only route that persists these three — IAM's create path accepts them in its request model and drops them, and the repository's update is a plain replace with no re-discovery, so values set here stick. **Read the tenant's discovery document for the correct endpoint values rather than composing them by hand** — see the last footgun.
4. **Inspect/manage the resulting identity-provider record** with `blocks auth idp list [--json]` / `blocks auth idp get <id> [--json]`. Use `blocks auth idp status <id> --active|--active=false` to enable/disable without deleting, and `blocks auth idp delete <id>` to remove it — deleting an identity provider **also deletes its related OIDC client registration**, so treat `idp delete` as the higher-blast-radius operation of the two.
5. **`blocks auth idp create`/`update` exist as a separate, more general path** for constructing an identity-provider record directly — most relevant when federating an *external* identity provider (Google, Azure AD, Okta, etc.) rather than using Blocks' own OIDC client as the login mechanism:
   ```
   blocks auth idp create --provider <p> --provider-type <t> --protocol <proto> \
     --client-id <id> [--client-secret <secret>] [--display-name] [--issuer] \
     [--scope] [--redirect-uris a,b] [--active] \
     [--authorization-url] [--token-url] [--user-info-url] [--jwks-uri] \
     [--well-known-url] [--response-type] [--grant-types a,b] [--require-pkce] \
     [--token-endpoint-auth-method] [--initial-roles a,b] [--initial-permissions a,b] \
     [--icon] [--body '<json>'|--file <path>] [--dry-run] [--yes]
   ```
   `--provider`, `--provider-type`, `--protocol`, and `--client-id` are required on create, and are immutable afterward — `auth idp update <id>` accepts the same flags but IAM requires you to either omit them or echo the existing values exactly. Apple-specific fields (`teamId`, `keyId`, `privateKey`, `appleAudience`) go through `--body`/`--file` so no private key lands in shell history. Note that `create` stores `issuer`, `jwksUri` and `wellKnownUrl` but silently drops `authorizationUrl`, `tokenUrl` and `userInfoUrl` — pass those to `idp update` in a second call. **How exactly a `clientId` passed here pairs with an OIDC client record is not shown anywhere documented** — the two collections are related (per the cascading delete behavior above) but the create/update commands don't expose an explicit "link to this OIDC client" field beyond passing the same id. If you need to federate an external provider, treat `idp create`'s field values as IAM's contract and confirm anything beyond the flags above against the tenant's actual behavior rather than guessing.
6. **Hand off.** Once a client id (and, if relevant, an identity-provider id) exists, the frontend wiring — login button, callback route, token handling, `client.auth.idp.initiate()`/`redirectToProvider()`/`.callback()` from `@seliseblocks/client` — is owned by **blocks-iam-sso-oidc-implementation**. Do not duplicate that work here; route to it.

## Mutation discipline

Every create/update/delete/status/rotate-secret command above follows the same pattern as the rest of `blocks`:
- `--dry-run` prints the request body and target endpoint without sending it (secrets are redacted in the printed body).
- Without `--dry-run`, the command prompts "Type 'yes' to continue" before mutating anything, unless `--yes` is passed to skip the prompt.
- These are real tenant-security actions (an identity provider or public OIDC client controls who can authenticate as a given app's users) — always show the user what will happen (favor `--dry-run` first) rather than running mutations silently, and don't add `--yes` to a call the user hasn't actually approved.

Never raw `fetch`/`curl` these endpoints to route around the CLI's confirmation/dry-run discipline — use the commands above so the same guardrails apply.

## Verified footguns

- **`--client-type public` is not cosmetic — omitting it stores a browser app as confidential.** IAM derives `tokenEndpointAuthMethod` from `clientType`: `public` (or any device-flow client) becomes `"none"`, anything else becomes `"client_secret_post"`. Leave `--client-type` off and a PKCE SPA is persisted as a confidential client that is also eligible for the `client_credentials` grant. Always pass `--client-type public` for a browser client. `--require-pkce` alone does not imply it.
- **The CLI supplies one discovery field; endpoint population is backend behavior.** `oidc-clients save --register-as-identity-provider` and interactive `new web` send `externalDiscoveryEndpoint`, derived from the OIDC URL and tenant unless explicitly overridden. This repository cannot prove that production IAM successfully resolves it or fills `authorizationUrl`, `tokenUrl`, `userInfoUrl`, `jwksUri`, and `issuer`; verify the provider after creation.
- **Do not assume re-saving repairs an incomplete provider.** If verification shows null endpoint fields, use `idp update` with values read from a successfully fetched discovery document, or recreate only after explicit approval.
- **PKCE and the discovery URL exist on both records and mean different things.** `requirePkce` on the OIDC client governs the app's own authorize flow; `--require-pkce` on `auth idp` governs the *upstream* handshake the initiate call performs. `--external-discovery-endpoint` on the client is read only as the linked provider's `wellKnownUrl`; on the provider record itself use `--well-known-url`.
- **Do not compose the tenant's own discovery or authorize URL from a template.** `DiscoveryController` declares `/{tenant_id}/.well-known/openid-configuration` as an absolute route, outside the `/iam/v4` prefix that every other IAM endpoint sits behind, and every `wellKnownUrl` example in IAM's own source and tests is an *external* provider (`accounts.google.com`, `login.microsoftonline.com`, `idp.example.com`) — there is no in-repo example of a Blocks tenant pointing at itself. Whether that route resolves through the `blocksapi.<domain>` gateway as-is or needs an extra segment is **not settled in source**. Fetch the tenant's discovery document and read the endpoints out of it, or ask the user; do not assert a shape you have not seen respond.

## Secondary, optional: the SDK's `identityProviders` admin methods

`@seliseblocks/client` (see `auth-client.ts`, the `readonly identityProviders = { list, get, create, update, updateStatus, delete }` block) also exposes typed methods that call the same identity-provider resource the CLI's `auth idp` commands hit. Reach for this when you're building an **in-app admin settings screen** for a signed-in administrator, where *they* click a button labeled something like "Add identity provider" and *they* fill in a form, in the moment they personally intend to make that change:

```tsx
// A settings page for a signed-in admin user. The admin types into the form
// and clicks "Save" themselves — the SDK call fires from THEIR click handler.
async function onSaveClicked(formValues: IdentityProviderFormValues) {
  await client.auth.identityProviders.create(formValues); // admin-initiated, in the moment
}
```

Request/payload types on these SDK methods are intentionally loose (`Record<string, unknown>` passthrough) — confirm field names against the same contract the CLI's `auth idp create` flags document (`provider`, `providerType`, `protocol`, `clientId`, etc.) rather than guessing new ones.

## Related skills

- **blocks-bootstrap** — owns `blocks login` itself (authenticates with no setup, nothing to register or look up). Go there first if `blocks` itself isn't authenticated, or if the user is conflating "logging in the CLI" with "SSO for my app."
- **blocks-iam-sso-oidc-implementation** — owns everything that happens once an identity provider/client id exists: wiring the login button, callback route, and token/session handling in the scaffolded React app using `@seliseblocks/client`. This skill hands off to it and does not duplicate its content.

## Example trigger prompts → routing

- "Enable SSO for my project" / "Set up an OIDC identity provider" / "Configure single sign-on for my app" → confirm it's the app's end-user login (not the CLI's), run the decision tree above (`auth oidc-clients list/get` → `auth oidc-clients save --register-as-identity-provider` if none exists), then hand off to **blocks-iam-sso-oidc-implementation**.
- "Register an OIDC client so users can log in" → `blocks auth oidc-clients list`/`get` first to avoid duplicates, then `blocks auth oidc-clients save` with `--dry-run` shown to the user before confirming.
- "Can you just create the identity provider via the API so I don't have to click through the portal?" → yes — walk them through `blocks auth oidc-clients save` / `blocks auth idp create` with `--dry-run` first, get explicit confirmation before dropping `--yes`, and mention the portal (https://os.seliseblocks.com) as an alternative if they'd rather use a GUI, especially for federated external providers where they need to register with that provider first.
- "blocks login isn't working" / "not_logged_in" → this is the CLI's own login, not this skill — route to **blocks-bootstrap**.
- "I want an admin page in my app where I can manage identity providers" → this skill's SDK section applies: help build the settings screen calling `identityProviders.list/create/update/delete` from the admin's own button clicks.
