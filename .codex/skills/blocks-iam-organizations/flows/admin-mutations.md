# Flow: Admin-CRUD surface — confirm the exact change first

These mutate tenant-level state. Build them as an explicit feature in an admin settings screen (SDK), or run them as an operator from a terminal with a reviewed `--dry-run` (CLI). Both surfaces exist and are equally real — see "The platform boundary" in [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md).

## SDK methods

### `organizations.list(query)` / `organizations.get(id)` — browse and inspect

Read-only, so no confirmation is needed to call them — but they're part of the admin org-management surface (browsing arbitrary orgs, not just "my own"), so gate the screen itself behind whatever admin permission the app already checks. Typical use: an org-picker/detail view feeding into an edit form, populated before a `create`/`update` call.

```ts
const page = await blocksClient.iam.organizations.list({ Page: 1, PageSize: 20, "Filter.Name": search });
const org = await blocksClient.iam.organizations.get(organizationId);
```

### `organizations.create(request)` / `organizations.update(id, request)`

Create/edit an organization's record (name, description, contact info, branding, addresses, default roles/permissions for new members, etc. — verify current field names against what the admin UI/API actually accepts rather than assuming they haven't changed).

```ts
// Only after the admin has reviewed and confirmed this exact payload:
await blocksClient.iam.organizations.create({
  name: "Acme Logistics",
  description: "Acme's logistics division workspace"
  // ...remaining fields the user confirmed
});

await blocksClient.iam.organizations.update(organizationId, {
  name: "Acme Logistics (Renamed)"
  // ...only the fields the user asked to change
});
```

### `organizations.getConfig()` / `organizations.saveConfig(request)` — org-level settings

Project/org-wide policy, including multi-org enablement. Read the current config first, show the user the diff of what would change, then save.

```ts
const current = await blocksClient.iam.organizations.getConfig();
// ...user reviews current vs. proposed, confirms...
await blocksClient.iam.organizations.saveConfig({
  ...current,
  isMultiOrgEnabled: true
});
```

### `signupSettings.save(request)` — save signup policy

Same confirm-first rule: this changes what the public signup screen allows for every future visitor, so restate the exact policy change (e.g., "turn on org creation from signup") before calling.

```ts
await blocksClient.iam.signupSettings.save({
  ...currentSettings,
  allowOrgCreationFromSignup: true
});
```

## CLI surface — scripting/inspection, outside an app UI

For anything that isn't a feature inside a running Blocks app (one-off lookups, ops scripts, CI checks), the `blocks` CLI has a matching, project-scoped command for every SDK method above except `switchOrganization` (see [read-and-switch.md](read-and-switch.md)). Every command below requires a project already selected (`blocks use <tenantId>`) — they all call IAM through an impersonated project token via `selectedProject()`, the same tenant scoping the SDK calls get from the app's own session.

| CLI command | Maps to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `blocks iam organizations list` | `organizations.list()` | `--search`, `--is-disabled`, `--parent-organization-id`, `--ids <a,b>`, `--page`, `--page-size`, `--sort-by`, `--sort-desc`. Read-only. |
| `blocks iam organizations get <id>` (or `--id`) | `organizations.get(id)` | Read-only. |
| `blocks iam organizations my` | `organizations.my()` | Read-only. |
| `blocks iam organizations create --name <n> [...]` | `organizations.create()` | `--name` (required), `--description`, `--email`, `--phone-number`, `--website-url`, `--default-permissions`, `--default-roles`, or a full `--body '<json>'`/`--file <path.json>`. Mutation. |
| `blocks iam organizations update <id> [...]` | `organizations.update(id, ...)` | `--name`, `--description`, `--email`, `--phone-number`, `--website-url`, `--currency`, `--industry`, `--locale`, `--time-zone`, `--is-enabled`, or `--body`/`--file`. Mutation. |
| `blocks iam organizations config get` | `organizations.getConfig()` | Read-only. |
| `blocks iam organizations config save [...]` | `organizations.saveConfig()` | `--multi-org-enabled`, `--consent-for-multi-org-enable`, `--allow-org-creation-from-signup`, `--allow-org-creation-from-portal`, `--allow-org-creation-from-cloud`, `--allow-org-creation-from-construct`, or `--body`/`--file`. Mutation. |
| `blocks iam signup-settings get` | `signupSettings.get()` | Read-only. |
| `blocks iam signup-settings save [...]` | `signupSettings.save()` | `--email-password-signup`, `--sso-signup`, `--default-permissions`, `--default-roles`, or `--body`/`--file`. Mutation. The CLI reads the current settings and merges, because the endpoint stores all four fields from the body (omitted booleans become false, omitted lists empty). SDK callers must send all four every time -- the GET spells the lists `defaultRolesForNewUser`/`defaultPermissionsForNewUser`, the POST needs `...OnSignUp`. |

```bash
blocks use <tenantId>                              # select the project once per session
blocks iam organizations list --search acme --json
blocks iam organizations config get --json
blocks iam organizations config save --multi-org-enabled --dry-run   # review the request body first
blocks iam organizations config save --multi-org-enabled --yes       # only after the user confirms
```

Every mutating command (`create`, `update`, `config save`, `signup-settings save`) supports `--dry-run` (prints the resolved request body without calling the API) and requires either `--yes` or an interactive `yes` at a confirmation prompt to actually run — the same "state the exact change, get an explicit go-ahead" discipline as the SDK guidance above, just enforced by the CLI itself instead of app code you write.

Boolean configuration flags preserve explicit false values. For example,
`--multi-org-enabled=false` and `--email-password-signup=false` send `false`;
omitting those flags leaves the corresponding fields out.

## Gotchas

- **The CLI has real organization/signup-settings commands** — don't tell a user there's no `blocks` command for organizations; there is, it's just project-scoped and separate from the SDK path used inside an app.
- **Confirm the payload, not just the intent**, before any `create`/`update`/`saveConfig`/`signupSettings.save` call — SDK or CLI — restate which organization and which fields are changing, old value vs. new, and wait for a clear yes. On the CLI this means running with `--dry-run` first and only adding `--yes` after that review.
- **These are legitimate app/operator features, not agent shortcuts.** It's fine to build a "Create Organization" admin screen with a confirm dialog, or run the CLI command yourself with a human's go-ahead — that's the intended use. It's not fine for an agent to call `organizations.create`/`saveConfig` (CLI or SDK) on its own initiative (e.g., to "set things up" for a demo) without that human-in-the-loop step.
- **Different response shapes per call** — `my()`/`list()` return an array-shaped payload, `get(id)` returns a single organization, `create` returns an id. Don't assume a single envelope shape across all of them; check the actual response before wiring UI to a field path.
